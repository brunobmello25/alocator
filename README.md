# Alocator

A simple malloc-style memory allocator written in C for learning purposes.

## Why

I wanted to get back into C programming. My last C project was a college assignment in late 2018—while it was a lot of fun, I knew far less back then than I do today.

## Reference

This allocator is implemented based on Arjun Sreedharan’s article: [Memory Allocators 101: Write a Simple Memory Allocator](https://arjunsreedharan.org/post/148675821737/memory-allocators-101-write-a-simple-memory)
